# ODK XLSForm Template

The ODK XLSForm Template is part the ODK project, a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. Learn more about ODK [here](https://getodk.org/) and read about example ODK deployments [here](https://forum.getodk.org/c/showcase).

[XLSForm](https://docs.getodk.org/xlsform/) is a spreadsheet-based form authoring standard for the ODK ecosystem. This template is intended to be an authoritative reference that is maintained by the ODK team alongside the XLSForm standard and other documentation.

The source is managed as a Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v9Bumt3R0vCOGEKQI6ExUf2-8T72-XXp_CbKKTACuko/edit#gid=0). This repository contains an XLSX export to link to.
